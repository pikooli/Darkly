-------------------------- Countermeasure ----------------------------------------
    - Don't display any error message from the sql request
    - Use Prepared Statements :
        exemple :   dbh->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME = ? AND PASSWORD = ?");
                    stmt->execute(array($username, $password));
    - Limite privilege on the query request, you should limit the search to only what originaly show in the result,
        only first name and surname
